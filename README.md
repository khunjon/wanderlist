### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Set up the database schema using `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Configure authentication providers (Email/Password and Google OAuth)
4. **Set up storage bucket for profile photos**:
   - Create a public bucket named `profile-photos`
   - Storage policies are automatically configured via the schema
   - Supports user-specific folder structure for security
5. Configure Row Level Security policies (included in schema)
6. Deploy database functions for optimized operations

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/setup/supabase-configuration.md](./docs/setup/supabase-configuration.md).

### Cursor MCP Integration

This project includes Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for enhanced AI-assisted development with Supabase:

#### Quick Setup
1. **Generate Personal Access Token** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Add token to environment**: `SUPABASE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token`
3. **Restart Cursor** to enable MCP integration

#### MCP Capabilities
With MCP enabled, you can ask the AI to:
- **Database Operations**: Query tables, execute SQL, apply migrations
- **Schema Management**: List tables, analyze structure, generate TypeScript types
- **Function Development**: Deploy and test database functions
- **Performance Analysis**: Optimize queries and analyze indexes
- **Real-time Development**: Test changes instantly with live database access

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Example MCP-enhanced development commands:
# "Show me all tables in the database"
# "Execute this SQL query and show results"
# "Generate TypeScript types for the current schema"
# "Deploy this database function and test it"
```

See [docs/setup/mcp-integration.md](./docs/setup/mcp-integration.md) for complete MCP configuration and usage patterns.

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a new project in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable the Places API and Maps JavaScript API
3. Create an API key with appropriate restrictions
4. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file

## Next.js 15 Compatibility

This project has been updated to work with Next.js 15, which introduces some important changes:

- Dynamic route segments now receive params as a Promise that must be awaited
- Client components that use hooks like `useSearchParams` must be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- The project architecture separates server and client components for optimal performance

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy the application is using Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure to add all the environment variables listed in the Environment Setup section to your Vercel project settings.

### Supabase Auth Configuration

When deploying to Vercel, make sure to:
1. Add your deployment domain to the authorized domains list in Supabase Authentication settings
2. If testing on a preview deployment, add the preview URL to authorized domains as well
3. Configure proper redirect URLs for your production domain

## Troubleshooting

### Recent Fixes (June 2025)

#### âœ… Profile Photo Upload System Fixed
The profile photo upload functionality has been completely overhauled and fixed:
- **Storage Path Structure**: Fixed file path mismatch between upload function and storage policies
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Added Supabase storage domain to allowed image domains
- **Cache Busting**: Implemented automatic cache busting to ensure updated photos display immediately
- **Cross-Component Updates**: Profile photos now update instantly across navbar, profile page, and list author displays
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages
- **Image Compression**: Improved compression algorithm that preserves PNG transparency and handles all supported formats

#### âœ… Supabase RLS Infinite Recursion Fixed
The infinite recursion error in Row Level Security policies has been resolved. This was caused by circular dependencies between the `lists` and `list_collaborators` tables. The fix involved creating security definer functions to break the circular dependency. See [docs/troubleshooting/SUPABASE_RLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./docs/troubleshooting/SUPABASE_RLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details.

#### âœ… Debug Logging Cleanup
Extensive debug logging that was added during authentication troubleshooting has been cleaned up for production use. Essential error logging remains for debugging purposes.

#### âœ… 404 Page Navigation Improved
The 404 page now provides both "Back to Lists" and "Go Home" navigation options, allowing users to choose their preferred destination without requiring complex authentication context detection in error scenarios.

#### âœ… List Loading Performance Optimization
Implemented a comprehensive hybrid client/server solution that resolves hanging query issues while optimizing performance:
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Automatically switches between server-side API and client-side queries based on performance
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Request caching (30s), user token caching (5min), and HTTP caching headers
- **Parallel Database Queries**: Fetch list and places data simultaneously for 2x speed improvement
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic fallback and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic tracking and adaptive routing based on response times

See [docs/architecture/LIST_LOADING_OPTIMIZATION.md](./docs/architecture/LIST_LOADING_OPTIMIZATION.md) for complete technical details.

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems
If you encounter authentication errors:
1. Check your Supabase project URL and keys in `.env.local`
2. Verify authentication providers are enabled in Supabase dashboard
3. For Google Auth: Add your domain to authorized domains in Supabase Auth settings

#### Database Connection Issues
If you experience database connectivity problems:
1. Verify your Supabase project is active (not paused)
2. Check Row Level Security policies are properly configured
3. Ensure your service role key has necessary permissions
4. If you see infinite recursion errors, refer to the RLS troubleshooting guide

#### MCP Integration Issues
If MCP tools aren't working:
1. Verify `SUPABASE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set correctly
2. Restart Cursor after adding the token
3. Check that your Supabase project has the necessary permissions
