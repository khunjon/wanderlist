## Key Technologies

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Real-time)
- **Maps**: Google Places API, Google Maps
- **Development**: Cursor IDE with MCP integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Migration Journey
- **From**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- **To**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Benefits**: 80% faster queries, enhanced security, better developer experience

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Start with MCP**: Use Cursor AI to check database state
2. **Test database changes**: Validate queries with MCP tools
3. **Generate types**: Keep TypeScript types in sync
4. **Monitor performance**: Use Supabase dashboard

### Common Tasks
- **Database queries**: Use MCP for immediate testing
- **Schema changes**: Apply migrations and regenerate types
- **Performance optimization**: Analyze queries with EXPLAIN
- **Security testing**: Validate RLS policies

## Getting Help

### For Setup Issues
1. Check [Environment Setup](./setup/environment-setup.md)
2. Review [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting/)
3. Verify environment variables and API keys

### For Development Issues
1. Use MCP tools for database debugging
2. Check [Migration Issues](./troubleshooting/migration-issues.md) for known problems
3. Review [System Architecture](./architecture/system-design.md) for design patterns

### For Performance Issues
1. Use Supabase dashboard for query analysis
2. Check [Performance Considerations](./architecture/system-design.md#performance-considerations)
3. Review database indexes and RLS policies

## Contributing to Documentation

### When to Update Documentation
- **New features**: Document setup and usage patterns
- **Bug fixes**: Add to troubleshooting guides
