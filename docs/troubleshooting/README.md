*RLS infinite recursion and connection issues have been resolved*
```bash
# 1. Check Supabase dashboard status
# 2. Verify connection string
# 3. Test with direct SQL query in dashboard
# 4. Check RLS policies aren't blocking access
```

#### **✅ App Won't Load/Build Fails - CURRENT**
```bash
# 1. Clear all caches and reinstall
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 2. Check for TypeScript errors
